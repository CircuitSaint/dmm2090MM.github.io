    <h3><span id="power_Supply">Power Supply</span></h3>
    &emsp;I jumped into the power supply project a little late. I had some success with the mini-projects leading up to this project. In all honesty, some intention success, some
    not so intentional. The purpose of the project was to make a power supply that would plug into a 120V wall outlet and output 5V. The power supplies would be used for the rest
    of the semester in future projects. I jumped on board with a classmate that organized the components on the perf board. I took over soldering the components to the perf board,
    and he soldered the transformer to the scrap computer power cables. While soldering, we discussed designs for the casing and how the perf board, transformer, fuses, would fit
    properly and connect.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><span id="resistor_Ladders">Resistor Ladders</span></h3>
    &emsp;Our first day of class for the semester back, we built a resistor ladder, which is a set of resistors in parallel
    with the ground sides connected to a series of resistors half the value of the parallel set. At the end of the set
    of series resistors, is a resistor the same value used in the parallel set. The resistor ladder creates multiple
    voltage dividers.  In the first iteration, I used two parallel circuits with 510 ohm resistor and momentary push buttons.
    The first push button resulted in a voltage of 3.57 volts, and the second button resulted in 5V. The second iteration,
    with two additional parallel sets, the results were 2.5V, 3.0V, 3.3V, and 3.5V.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><span id="solenoid">Solenoid</span></h3>
    &emsp;When creating a solenoid, I tried to create one with the intention of making a quick model of a solenoid valve. Much
    of my time was spent on wrapping wire around a pen (my air core), and using super glue to hold the wire in place. My
    initial tests, at 150 wraps, did not provide a magnetic field. I tested my coil with a range or 5 -12 volts and 0.5 - 2 amps,
    a small and large magnet, and BB’s. After the 12V began to melt the super glue from my solenoid, I decided to start over and
    wrapped the core with an additional 100 wraps, to bring my total to 250 wraps. When testing my solenoid again, I was able
    to see a very small wiggle of my solenoid when holding a magnet above it. The wiggle was so small, I initially thought it
    was shake in the table from another classmate. Ultimately, the solenoid wasn’t strong enough to have a working model of the
    solenoid valve, but I did demonstrate to my classmates how the valve would work. If I were to make a solenoid again, I
    would do a better job of concentrating the wraps within a shorter length. My solenoid essentially was the length of an entire pen.

    <h3><span id="logic_Gates">Logic Gates</span></h3>
    &emsp;The purpose of the project was to use 3 to 4 7400 series chips to in a practical application. I decided to build a model of
    40 yard dash obstruction indicator. I used four ultrasonic sensors to detect motion in the runner’s path, and I used the 7400
    IC’s to control LEDs for the runner to see the detection. After setting up the hardware, testing one sensor, I added all four,
    and had to troubleshoot programming the Arduino. In my progression to find a working iteration of the code, I noticed my
    sensors would output a signal, but would not read the input signal due to how the code was compiled and read. To get all four
    sensors working I used a for loop, which allowed the sensors to output and read input fast enough to produce a distance.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><span id="pcb_Design">PCB Design</span></h3>
    &emsp;In my final projects, I tried to master making PCBs. In order to start, I revisited a project we did earlier in the semester,
    AC/DC power converter.  I revisited this projected, because I felt like I needed a better understanding of what was going on
    in the circuit. My goal was to have 120 AC input, with a dual DC output of 5V and 12V on a PCB with LED indicators for each
    DC output. I started by tweaking a previous schematic in fritzing, adding my 7812, LEDs and corresponding resistors. I
    organized the PCB in fritzing as well so that my traces didn’t cross unless they were meant to be connected. After exporting
    from fritzing to illustrator, I edited my SVG document in order to laser engrave my painted PCB. The first time, I laser
    engraved my circuit, when I should have engraved the inverse of my circuit, so that only by circuit was left painted. My
    second iteration, I edited in inkscape instead of illustrator, as inkscape is open source and would be available to be at home.
    The engraving turned out really well, and I went into drilling holes for my components with a rotary tool. I found that the 1mm
    and 0.9mm drill bits work best for most components. After drilling holes, I used PCB etchant to get rid of the unnecessary copper,
    then acetone to remove the paint which protected the circuit. I found that soldering compnent onto a PCB was a lot easier than soldering
    on a perf board and creating my own traces. The final product turned well overall. Both DC outputs provided a consisten voltage and 1 amp.
    However, my 5V output terminals actually output about 9.77V. After checking my schematic, and PCB, I determine the 7805 max input voltage
    was probably less than the 24V I supplied it with. Some datasheets for 7805s had a max voltage of about 30V, whereas some had a max of 18V.
    Later on I used a similar process to develop PCBs for a L293D, of which I used for both a DC motor, and a Nema 17 stepper motor. I also
    created a PCB for my thermistors in my automated gardening project.

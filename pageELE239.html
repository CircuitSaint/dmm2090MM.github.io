        <h1>ELE 239 Programmable Controllers</h1>
        <p>The Programmanle Controllers course at Piedmont Virginia Community College focuses on Programmable Logic Controllers(PLCs),
          ladder logic, alternating current and direct current components, and inputs and output components for industrial uses. The guiding textbook we
          used is <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Programmable+Logic+Controllers%3A+A+Practical+Approach+to+IEC+61131+3+using+CoDeSys-p-9781118949245" target="_blank"> Programmable Logic Controllers: A Practical Approach to IEC 61131-3 using CoDeSys.</a>

  <h3><span id="humanoid_Systems">20 August 2018</span></h3>
  &emsp;As an introductory excercise to the class, created systems using human beings. Our first system included everyone from the entire class.
  We had one person signally when the system would turn on, a person spinning another person, a person removing and replacing a person's hat, a
  person stored the values for the input data, and a person adjusting one set of lights based on the amount of rotations and turning on/off another
  set of lights based on the position of the cap. As a system check, another person read the stored values and signaled if the stored values and light adjustments were not true.
<br>
<br>
  &emsp;Our second project was another human system. However, this time we split into smaller groups. Our intention was to create a system that would stup the remaining group, as they were to observe and dissect the system.
  My group decided we would try to deceive the other group by using the clock as our initial input. Every 10 seconds, I would nod, another person would flip a cup, the third person counted how many times the cup had been flipped upside down and right-side up.
  The same person was the system check if one person was out of sync. After the cup had been flipped upside down and right-side up 5 times, the remaining team member would stand up. Other than the time it took to flip a cup, I think we did a great job at making the system
  complicated enough for the other group to not fully find out what was taking place.
<br>
<br>
  <h3><span id="pinball_Systems">27 August 2018</span></h3>
  &emsp;Our first project was introduced, which was to create a pinball concept in a ladder logic diagram. Our guidelines were to have ten digital outputs with variety, contain one human input to turn on the system, a system to keep track of the score, and a story or theme for
  the pinball machine. My partner, Tom, and I began with deciding our theme, sensors we would use, scoring opportunities, and visual clues for the user. We decided on a magical forest theme. We began to work on a progressive scoring opportunity, where after triggering one sensor,
  a point would be awarded and an LED would turn on. When four sensors where triggered and the corresponding LEDs were lit, an additional point would be awarded. In our ladder logic draft, we had rung with four outputs. We decided to use the same inputs on multiple rungs, while changing
  the outputs. After figuring out a few sensors, we felt like we had to tackle the scoring system. After throwing around a few ideas, we concluded having physical number plates, similar to an older clock. When the player scored a point, a piston would push to the next number plate. In order to
  reset the score, the number zero would be metal, and the machine would cycle threw the numbers until an induction sensor was triggered by the metal zero plate. We felt fairly good about our ideas before we left class. We left off with needing to write a program for the game resetting when the
  ball bypassed the flippers, and a program for our flippers.

  <h3><span id="stop_Lights">24 September 2018</span></h3>
  &emsp;In class, we were introduced to adding timers and counters. The three timers we were introduced to we time on, time off, and time pulse. The three counters we were introduced to were count up, count down, and count up/down.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3><span id="test_Bench">5 November 2018</span></h3>
  &emsp;When using our <a href="PDF/ClickPLC.pdf">Click PLC</a> we learned that the "C" ports on the PLC modules were common ground for the input or outputs following the specific "C" port.
  We had a hard time troubleshooting our buzzer with the PLC. We were able to hardwire the buzzer on, and we were able to program the PLC to turn on the corresponding lights for the output port.
  However, we were not able to have the PLC turn on our buzzer. I also found out my <a href="PDF/PLC_BuzzerBoard_1_schem.pdf">original schematic</a> would not work, mainly due not fully understanding nor referencing the datasheet for the PLC modules.

  <h3><span id="structured_text">12 November 2018</span></h3>
  &emsp; An introduction to <a href="images/Structed_text_example">structured text in CodeSys</a>. We also deciphered an example from page 285 in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Programmable+Logic+Controllers%3A+A+Practical+Approach+to+IEC+61131+3+using+CoDeSys-p-9781118949245" target="_blank">Programmable Logic Controllers: A Practical Approach to IEC 61131-3 using CoDeSys</a>.
  In addition to our introduction to structured text, we were given time to brainstorm for our final project. <a href="PDF/s71200_system_manual_en-US_en-US.pdf">Siemens Simatic S7-1200</a>

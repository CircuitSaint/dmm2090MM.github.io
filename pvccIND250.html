           In our first class, we learned how to adjust our orientation, create new sketches, and set our default
           unit of measurement in Fusion 360. I found it extremely helpful to go over the basics considering we will be using
           this software for another class.
        </p>
        <h4>28 Jan 2019</h4>
         <p>
           We used a sketch of a caliper to learn how to create tool paths. It felt like a ton of steps, but I felt fairly good about
           the process, as I was able to reference previous experience with the
           <a href="https://carbide3d.com/carbidecreate/"><strong>Carbide Create</strong></a> and <a href"https://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve-pro"><strong>VCarve Pro</strong>.</a>

          Review of creating tool paths in Fusion 360 with a Universal Laser Systems post processor.

         <p>
           The question that was prompted to us today was, "What is the difference between work coordinate system and the machine coordinate offset?" My initial thought is that the work coordinate system is related to the CAD/CAM process,
           whereas the machine coordinate offset is related to the physical machine's position related to the stock material. We experimented with depth per pass, spindle speed, feedrate, and plunge rate. During our experiment, I documented
           on the white board above our Nomad 833 Pro.
         </p>
         <h4>18 Feb 2019</h4>
          <p>
            Today, we looked at the g-code that we generated from Fusion 360 for our Nomad 883 Pro. Some codes were obvious such as S6000, being the spindle speed. Some were less obvious such as, G90.1 and G91.1, which relates to arc distance mode. We used the
            <a href="https://www.tormach.com/machine-codes/"><strong>Tormach Machine References</strong></a>.

             Part of today was generating CAM for a 2D piece. The piece given to use was a wrench, but we were allowed to choose anything after going through the process.
             <br>
             <br>At this point, I had not cut my wheel piece for the Nomad 883. Dustin and I spent some time outside
             of class reviewing our CAM setup. Both of us had hesitation in regards to crashing the machine or breaking tooling. Going through the setup and operations with each other, allowed us to figure out what certain settings meant. One conformation that took place for
             me was stock orientation. When explaining the process, it clicked for me. In addition, I discovered/learned that the way Fusion understands the final depth of cut is related to the selection in the geometry tab. Once a geometry is selected, you can then make adjustments
             to the offsets in the heights tab. We started cutting our bolt wheel the same day, which included a facing operation for the bottom of the stock. We ended up running the facing operation twice, because we still had an uneven surface, and battled to keep our stock clamped
             into place. After eventually facing both sides, we decided to call it a day.

           <h4>4 March 2019</h4>
            <p>
              At this time, I spent a bunch of time either helping people cut aluminum stock for their wrench project, assisting with CAM in Fusion 360, and observing Professor Bredder and a group of students go through the machining process on Tormach PCNC 1100. Because I wasn't sure I wanted
              a wrech to be my 2D profile item, I also spent some time figuring out what I wanted to cut. I believe this is also one of the nights I stayed late to troubleshoot why the 2D Contour for the wrench continued beyond our .03" depth of cut, and figuring out a good system to clamp our
              material down with MDF spoilboard.
            </p>
          <h4>18 March 2019</h4>
           <p>
             This week was similar in regards to cutting stock, assisting others, and observation. At the time I was hesitant to try to cut my own piece, even though I felt very confident in my understanding of the process.
           </p>
           <h4>25 March 2019</h4>
            <p>
              This week was more about work flow, and learning proper tool usage. One of the items we spoke about were using HSS drill bits to at minimum predrill holes in order to save our end mills. In addition to CAM, making an item in CAD and going through work flow
              was just as meaningful to me.

               Today was an introduction to soft jaws, which I would define as dispensable aluminum clamps. The soft jaws would allow us to hold our stock material in the vice and give ourselves room to cut without ramming our tool into the vice. Ultimately, creating the soft jaws
               became a practical assessment of the procedures to create multiple setups and multiple cut operations. One of the benefits of the soft jaw project was discussing the work flow of cutting a part. Specifically, making a level reference point by using our facing opertion,
               and which side(s) should be faced earlier.
               <br>
               <br>
               Our final project guideline was also introduced. At the time, I decided to design and cut a flip jig and threaded table for the Nomad 883 Pro desktop CNC machine. I wanted to do this project out of need for my lab at Community Middle, and for the PVCC lab.
             </p>
             <h4>8 April 2019</h4>
              <p>
                During this point in class, I was doing a combination of helping fellow classmates with creating CAM, and making alterations to my Nomad 883 Pro parts. I was still pretty hesitant to machine aluminum, I guess a fear of breaking a tool.
              </p>
              <h4>15 April 2019</h4>
               <p>
                 Around this point in class, I changed my final project to picture frames, as I and another teacher were collaborating on a photography project. This was a good test for me to ensure I had a parametric design, and to design based on customer need.
                 After designing four frames and cutting a prototype on the ShopBot Buddy out of 3/8 inch plywood, the teacher and I made some small but significant changes to the frame dimensions in order for the matboard to properly fit into the frame. I spent my
                 class time assisting other students, and discussing project ideas.
               </p>
               <h4>23 April 2019</h4>
                <p>
                  In my next steps of cutting picture frame, I walked a class of students through the process of securing stock onto <a href="https://www.shopbottools.com/products/buddy"><strong>ShopBot Buddy</strong></a>, homing the machine, loading .spb file, and cutting. The first job was only one frame. During the rest of the week, I put three frames in
                  the same job. One thing I noticed while adding multiple frames to the same job, if setup is post processed and other projects are added later, the offsets are no longer accurate. Instead of being able to use the same stock and setup for my frames and exchange the frames
                  for a new batch, I had to start a new file, load in my designs, then start my setup and opertations from scratch. A few times, I lost my coordinate position, this would happen if I paused the machine a few times while attempting to make a correction. In order to refind my
                  position, I would pick a portion of the job that was already cut, and try to re-home the machine so that my pass above would align properly to the previous cut.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I also had multiple opportunities to help other students cut their projects on the Tormach PCNC 1100 and Tormach PCNC 700. After gaining confidence in measuring the tooling, and gaining confidence of seeing the machine exacute the gcode, I felt a lot better about cutting aluminum.
                  A couple of times, a tool was damage, but normally it was mistake the student and I could figure out quickly. By the end of the class, I felt really comfortable setting up and cutting metal.

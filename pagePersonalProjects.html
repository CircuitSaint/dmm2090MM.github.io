    <h3><span id="humanoid_Systems">20 August 2018</span></h3>
    &emsp;As an introductory excercise to the class, created systems using human beings. Our first system included everyone from the entire class.
    We had one person signally when the system would turn on, a person spinning another person, a person removing and replacing a person's hat, a
    person stored the values for the input data, and a person adjusting one set of lights based on the amount of rotations and turning on/off another
    set of lights based on the position of the cap. As a system check, another person read the stored values and signaled if the stored values and light adjustments were not true.
  <br>
  <br>
    &emsp;Our second project was another human system. However, this time we split into smaller groups. Our intention was to create a system that would stup the remaining group, as they were to observe and dissect the system.
    My group decided we would try to deceive the other group by using the clock as our initial input. Every 10 seconds, I would nod, another person would flip a cup, the third person counted how many times the cup had been flipped upside down and right-side up.
    The same person was the system check if one person was out of sync. After the cup had been flipped upside down and right-side up 5 times, the remaining team member would stand up. Other than the time it took to flip a cup, I think we did a great job at making the system
    complicated enough for the other group to not fully find out what was taking place.
  <br>
  <br>
    <h3><span id="pinball_Systems">27 August 2018</span></h3>
    &emsp;Our first project was introduced, which was to create a pinball concept in a ladder logic diagram. Our guidelines were to have ten digital outputs with variety, contain one human input to turn on the system, a system to keep track of the score, and a story or theme for
    the pinball machine. My partner, Tom, and I began with deciding our theme, sensors we would use, scoring opportunities, and visual clues for the user. We decided on a magical forest theme. Our began to work on a progressive scoring opportunity, where after triggering one sensor,
    a point would be awarded and an LED would turn on. When four sensors where triggered and the corresponding LEDs were lit, an additional point would be awarded.
  <br>
  <br>
    <h3><span id="test_Bench">5 November 2018</span></h3>
    &emsp;When using our <a href="PDF/ClickPLC.pdf">Click PLC</a> we learned that the "C" ports on the PLC modules were common ground for the input or outputs following the specific "C" port.
    We had a hard time troubleshooting our buzzer with the PLC. We were able to hardwire the buzzer on, and we were able to program the PLC to turn on the corresponding lights for the output port.
    However, we were not able to have the PLC turn on our buzzer. I also found out my <a href="PDF/PLC_BuzzerBoard_1_schem.pdf">original schematic</a> would not work, mainly due not fully understanding nor referencing the datasheet for the PLC modules.
  <br>
  <br>
    &emsp;I jumped into the power supply project a little late, story regarding that will be posted to <a href="pageLearningEd.html">Learning & Education</a> soon. I had some success with the mini-projects leading up to this project. In all honesty, some intention success, some
    not so intentional. The purpose of the project was to make a power supply that would plug into a 120V wall outlet and output 5V. The power supplies would be used for the rest of the semester in future projects. I jumped on board with a classmate that organized the components
    on the perf board. I took over soldering the components to the perf board, and he soldered the transformer to the scrap computer power cables. While soldering, we discussed designs for the casing and how the perf baord, transformer, fuses, would fit properly and connect.

      <h4>The Beginning</h4>
        <p>
           In our first class, we learned how to adjust our orientation, create new sketches, and set our default
           unit of measurement in Fusion 360. I found it extremely helpful to go over the basics considering we will be using
           this software for another class.
        </p>
       <h4>Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          This class was a continuation of learning basics. We designed one part, while working on creating constraints to make parametric
          parts. This class was challenging as it was a lot of steps and the methodology is different from another software I'm familar with.
        </p>
        <h4>Making Connections</h4>
         <p>
           We dove into the process of creating parametric designs. By learning this process in fusion 360, I was able to reference my
           experience from OpenSCAD. My true test of parametric design was beginning the base for a <a href="images/projects/Flip Jig v5.f3d"><strong>flip jig</strong></a>.
           I needed to ensure I could change the height for different sized projects and to ensure the tool nor the spindle would ram into the jig.
         </p>
         <h4>Practice Makes Permanent</h4>
          <p>
            In continuation with my Nomad 883 Pro Flip Jig Project, I decided to make the threaded table for the same machine. The purpose of the threaded table was successfully create a pattern in Fusion 360.
            I would say this project is where I grew the most, and built those basic principles of constraints and creating <b><i>multiple objects</i></b>. One of the things I had to troubleshoot was the order in
            which I made holes and when to troubleshoot. For me, and there's probably a better way to do it, I created petruding pegs instead of holes. The reason I created pegs, was due to not having a selectable object
            to click on when I had a hole. After figuring that out, it was neat to discover I could pattern in two direction, x & y, in the same operation. The ending result was <a href="images/projects/table v6.f3d"><strong> this</strong></a>.
          </p>
         <h4>Threaded Experience</h4>
          <p>
            My experience with the threaded bolt and nut was interesting. I followed the example given to us had some a fair decent success. As a part of my job, a teacher
            suggested we introduce Fusion 360 to students by creating a bolt and nut. During the lesson, which was framed from my experience in class and the video, my students
            found the process to be very difficult. In retrospect, their experience and my experience showed me how much I had grown. I remember the feeling of my brain not being
            able to wrap around the spatial reasoning in Fusion 360. As this was their first experience with the program, I sympathize with "Where is that too?" and "I don't know
            how to move around this object."
          </p>
          <h4>A Test of Parametric Design</h4>
           <p>
             Around this point in class, I changed my final IND 250 project to picture frames, as I and another teacher were collaborating on a photography project. This was a good
             test for me to ensure I had a parametric design, and to design based on customer need. My biggest worry was needing to make adjusments for frames, and not being able
             to do them quickly for four different designs. I started with a basic rectangular frame, ensured I could change parameters for the inner, outer, and rabbet dimensions.
             After addressing the basics, I saved that frame, and created copies to modify. The next frames, I played around with modification tools, that lead to me creating a rounded frame,
             a weird chamfer frame, and an accent frame with a pattern. After designing four frames and cutting a prototype on the ShopBot Buddy out of 3/8 inch plywood, the teacher and I made
             some small but significant changes to the frame dimensions in order for the matboard to properly fit into the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Ho74Pgdz6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"><strong> frames</strong></a>
           </p>
          <h4>Revisiting the Basics</h4>
           <p>
             Whether it was true or not, I felt like I was behind most of my classmates in comprehending Fusion 360. Because of that, I did not see the opportunity to teach one of them, a
             test from myself whether I understand a concept. Just after my opportunity with my students, I had the opportunity to work with a teacher who has been using 123D Design but wanted
             to learn Fusion 360. During our time togther, we recreated some of his go to projects in Fusion 360, such as, a name plate, and boat. We also created a replacement parametric bandsaw insert.
             As a check for myself, this experience gave me confidence I was on the right path.
           </p>
           <h4>Final Project: Sliding Vice</h4>
            <p>
              For the project, I had to make a minimum of two items, which would fit together. I modeled my project after an existing product, with the intent of designing a parametric version which could be
              machined for other desktop CNC machines. My overall trouble was understanding how to measure and design machinable groves on the <a href="images/projects/Low Profile Vice Base v5.f3z"><strong> vice base</strong></a>. I carefully measured the lengths,
              and angles. I used those same measurements to created my vice clamps. The process was fun, and I was able to get into a real flow of breaking down the designing into smaller accomplishable parts. It was fun
              to play around with the material apperance and color. I also found some pleasure playing with the assemble funtion.
            </p>
            <h4>Certification Exam</h4>
             <p>
               I did not pass my exam, but it was a good indicator of my improvement and capability. Due to the short time to complete 25-30 questions, I had not completed enough to pass the exam. However, I felt my score
               was a good indicator of me getting the ones I attempted, correct. When taking the test, it took me awhile to get into a flow, due to the multiple screens. But, the questions they were asking, I felt like I had
               a good understanding of, and it was easier than I anticipated. After the exam, my classmates and I agreed, if we had more time, we had confidence in passing the certifcation exam.
